# Point_in_triangle.cpp
I solved this problem dividing the triangle for 3 parts.
And the I couted area of large triangle and 3 small triangles.
When the result od addition of 3 areas equals area of large triangle - the point is inside of triangle.
When not - the point is outside.
When the area of small triangle equals 0 - the point is on the triangle.
Wery important is how we placed these conditions - it is the key for good result.
